# SE F19 Final Project Group 1 Repository #

# Changelog #
Don't worry about using changelog if you don't want to, it's for documentation purposes ( It's good practice to though )

** Version 1.01
* Added changelog to readme.txt -> .md
* Added .gitignore file for whoever needs it
* Added Alexa JS Node skill code

### How to use .gitignore file ###

* Determine extensions or file names that you do not want to include into a commit
* add that to the textfile, 1 per line
* (*) Asterisks are wildcards, therefore *.txt will filter out all .txt files
* Be careful not to ignore the wrong files
